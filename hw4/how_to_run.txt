Hi, 

To run the file type 

"python3 fritz_anna_hw4.py > output.txt" 

into the terminal window. This will redirect the output from standard out to the file "output.txt" where you can see the result of alignment. 

Running the program also produces a file called "hmm_trimmed.txt". Don't be alarmed. This file is needed for the program to run as it is a trimmed version of the hmm file. When the program runs, it creates this file with the trimmed HMM sequence so the HMM can be taken into a data frame. DONT DELETE THIS FILE. It was the only way I could think to make it work. 

The program does take a few seconds to run. I would say around a minute. But it does run and runs for me on my MacOS using python3. 

If you want to change the protein sequence, you can put whatever one you want in the seq.fa file. Just make sure it is in fasta form with 

">NAME
sewfoaneoicnaef" 

or else the program will not run correctly.  

Thanks, 
Anna Fritz
